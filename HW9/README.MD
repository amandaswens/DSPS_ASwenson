1. I decided to improve the comparison of linear regression models plot made in HW #5. Although there wasn't much to change, I wanted to see if I could reduce a bit of the cluttering with the points. So, what I changed here was I made the figure a bit bigger. Specifically, I stretched out the horizontial axis to allow for a bit more room between each point so they are more decernible. I also changed the colors (not that it's that noticble), that way the regression lines are a bit more visible. Finally, I changed the axes' labels to clarify the units of Log time as well as explain the significance of the magnitude.
