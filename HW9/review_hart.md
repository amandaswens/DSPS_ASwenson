Part 1 Review:


Original Plot

I think that this plot is largely functional. It shows the data points uesd for the regression in different colors according to their classifications.
That helps any viewer understand the contents better and gives a good way of measuring the effectiveness of the regression plots. 

Some ambiguity arises from the close proximity of the regressions. It makes it a little difficult to determine which is which, but the different plot types do make that easier.
It is also bound to happen anyway with these fits.

There aren't that many distorted or distracting elements. The upper limits being present could count as a distortion, so they should probably be labelled or identified in a caption
just to clarify those parts. 

The effect size is accurate and the data/ink ratio is good. I think that the color coding and the labels helps to improve the data/ink ratio a lot. The figure is simple and isn't 
cluttered with 'chart junk'.

The proximity of the different colored points could prove to be a problem for a color blind viewer however. Some of the fit lines are also determined with colors that could be confused.

I think that increasing the size and horizontal axis reduces the ambiguity by making the plot more clear. The scale here makes it much easier to differentiate between the different types of fits.

The clarification on the magnitude axis that brighter stars correspond to lower values also helps to further reduce confusion (so does the inclusion of units on the time axis).

Overall, I think the changes make the plot easier to interpret without introducing factors of labels that might further complicate the figure and add 'chart junk'.

This figure has unclear labels and confusing subplots that are both vague and distracting. 

The exact units of the y-axis are also ambiguous and does not contain intervals or values (besides the three function components).

The lack of units on the y-axis in both the main plot and the subplots does distort the data because it is unclear what the relationship
between those subplots and the main plots are.



I don't think the effect size for this plot is very good at all. The data/ink ratio is also not ideal -- there aren't enough labels in my opinion. 

Besides the subplots, there actually isn't that much chart junk, but those things in particular are distracting. 

This plot doesn't use color at all, maybe to its detriment, so it won't cause any problems relating to color blindness.
