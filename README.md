Repository for PHYS461

1. I decided to take this class to fufill my major requirement as a physics major. This class will also contribute to my 4+1 program in MMSE.
2. I hope I learn more about Python and hope to master the language. I am pretty famiiliar with it now but would like to strengthen my skills, especially with syntax.
3. I believe my experience with astrophysics research will help me the most due to it's heavy reliance on Python and all things related to Data Science.
